# Why bother? #

It is often convenient to track changes to projects using an RSS feed.  Luckily the google-code team has made this easy to do by [surfacing feeds for hosted projects](http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2008/07/new-feeds-for-project-hosting-on-google.html).


# Feeds #

You can build your own custom feeds following the advice [here](http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2008/07/new-feeds-for-project-hosting-on-google.html).  As a jumping off point, here are a few useful ones:

  * [Issues](http://code.google.com/feeds/p/wt-commons/issueupdates/basic)
  * [Downloads](http://code.google.com/feeds/p/wt-commons/downloads/basic)
  * [Subversion changes](http://code.google.com/feeds/p/wt-commons/svnchanges/basic)
  * [Wiki changes](http://code.google.com/feeds/p/wt-commons/svnchanges/basic?path=/wiki/)
