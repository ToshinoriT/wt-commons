The WindowTester (WT) Commons Project provides a set of common elements for use in Eclipse/RCP application testing.

The WT Commons project is composed of four parts:

  * [Snippets](WTSnippets.md) - small, stand-alone pieces of code that demonstrate discrete bits of functionality.

  * [Samples](WTSamples.md) - more involved examples that have more dependencies and tend to explore broader themes.

  * [Helpers](WTHelpers.md) - reusable test components that can be used to build test scenarios.

  * [Incubator](WTIncubator.md) - an incubator for WT experiments and features in progress.




### Getting Involved ###

**WT Commons is for you.**  If you are interested in contributing, please send an [email](mailto:phil.quitslund@gmail.com) introducing yourself.  We'd love to have you aboard!


### Compatability ###

As a general rule, commons code tends to exploit the latest and greatest.  To use commons bits that depend on the WindowTester runtime, you'll want to be on the bleeding-edge and grab the most recent WT build.
